## Dependencies
This software uses Lucene.  It is currently written to work with a few libraries from 7.4.0.

This software makes use of Sean Leary's https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java.  It has the package name of org.json.  Some other 3rd party libraries also use this code, but with other versions.  To avoid this problem, I've simply changed the package name.  Also, a few minor modifications for java.util.Date handling have been made.
